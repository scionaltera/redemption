# Contributing
We welcome contributions and suggestions for Redemption. If you want to contribute, here are some basic guidelines.

## Check for planned work
Check the GitHub issues to see if there is something already planned similar to what you'd like to do. If there isn't, open an issue before doing work on it so that we can begin a conversation and design your new feature. There are few things as frustrating as finding out that the work you have already done isn't in line with the project vision or has already been done.

## Code Style
* Use a descriptive branch name. Name it after an issue or describe the feature you're adding. For example: `dashboard-visibility` or `fixes-issue-21`.
* Try to match the existing coding style as best as possible.
* Cover your new or changed code with unit tests. Ensure that `./gradlew clean buildDocker` passes successfully before you commit.

If you get stuck or have questions, feel free to go ahead and open your pull request. PRs are a good way to discuss proposed changes and resolve any problems.

## Start Small
If you have not contributed before, consider looking for an issue labeled `good first issue` for your first contribution. Those are ones that we think are fairly easy and low risk, and would make a good introductory pull request for new contributors.
