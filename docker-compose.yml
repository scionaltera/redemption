#
# This docker-compose.yml is meant to help with local development.
#
# Using docker-compose and this configuration file you can spin up Redemption and all the databases and other
# services it may need all at once to get a fully functional development copy of the software running. This
# environment is also configured to expose the remote debugging port (5005) on Redemption so that you can attach
# your debugger and use breakpoints to examine any problems you may find.
